### Jest

> Update (October 11, 2020): **We now recommend [@web/test-runner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web/test-runner) as our test runner of choice for Snowpack projects.** [See our section on testing](/#testing) for more background behind the change.

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a popular Node.js test runner for Node.js & web projects. Jest can be used with any frontend project as long as you configure how Jest should build your frontend files to run on Node.js. Many projects will try to manage this configuration for you, since it can get complicated.

Snowpack ships pre-built Jest configuration files for several popular frameworks. If you need to use Jest for any reason,consider extending one of these packages:

- React: [@snowpack/app-scripts-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snowpack/app-scripts-react)
- Preact: [@snowpack/app-scripts-preact](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snowpack/app-scripts-preact)
- Svelte: [@snowpack/app-scripts-svelte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snowpack/app-scripts-svelte)

You can use these packages in your project like so:

```js
// jest.config.js
// Example: extending a pre-built Jest configuration file
module.exports = {
  ...require('@snowpack/app-scripts-preact/jest.config.js')(),
};
```
