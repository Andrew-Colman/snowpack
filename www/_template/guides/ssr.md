### Server Side Rendering (SSR)

To connect your own server to `snowpack dev` for SSR, there are a few things that you'll need to set up. Make sure that you include any Snowpack-built resources via script tags in your server's HTML response:

```html
<!-- Example: Create Snowpack App builds your src/ directory to the /_dist_/* directory -->
<script type="module" src="http://localhost:8080/_dist_/index.js"></script>
```

And make sure that your HTML response also includes code to configure HMR to talk to Snowpack's dev server:

```html
<!-- Configure Snowpack's HMR connection yourself, somewhere on your page HTML -->
<script>
  window.HMR_WEBSOCKET_URL = 'ws://localhost:8080';
</script>
```
