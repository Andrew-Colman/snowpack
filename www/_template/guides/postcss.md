## PostCSS

```js
// snowpack.config.json
"plugins": [
  ["@snowpack/plugin-build-script", {"cmd": "postcss", "input": [".css"], "output": [".css"]}]
]
```

The [`postcss-cli`](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-cli) package must be installed manually. You can configure PostCSS with a `postcss.config.js` file in your current working directory.
