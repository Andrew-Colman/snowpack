### Sass

```js
// snowpack.config.json
"plugins": ["@snowpack/plugin-sass"]
```

[Sass](https://www.sass-lang.com/) is a stylesheet language thatâ€™s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

To use Sass + PostCSS, check out [this guide](https://zellwk.com/blog/eleventy-snowpack-sass-postcss/).
