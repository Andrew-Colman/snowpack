## Supported Libraries

All of the following frameworks have been tested and guaranteed to work in Snowpack without issues. If you encounter an issue using any of the following, please file an issue.

- React
- Preact
- JSX
- HTM
- lit-html
- Vue (see below)
- Svelte (see below)
- Tailwind CSS (see below)
- Sass (see below)
- and many more!
- Literally... every library should work with Snowpack!

Some libraries use compile-to-JS file formats and do require a special build script or plugin. See the guide below for examples.
